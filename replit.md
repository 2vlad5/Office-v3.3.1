## System Architecture

### Application Structure
The project follows a multi-project .NET solution architecture with separate console and desktop application components:

- **Console Application (OfficeApp.Console)**: Built on .NET 8.0, likely serves as a command-line utility or background service for administrative tasks
- **Desktop Application**: Windows Forms-based GUI application with user authentication features (LoginForm)

### Database Architecture
The system uses MySQL as the primary database with the following design decisions:

- **MySqlConnector**: Modern, high-performance MySQL driver chosen over the legacy MySql.Data connector
- **Version Strategy**: Uses MySqlConnector 2.4.0 with flexible versioning to allow minor updates
- **Connection Management**: Leverages Microsoft Extensions for dependency injection and logging abstractions

### Technology Stack
- **Runtime**: .NET 8.0 (latest LTS version for enhanced performance and security)
- **Database**: MySQL with MySqlConnector for optimal async performance
- **UI Framework**: Windows Forms for desktop interface
- **Dependency Management**: Microsoft Extensions for IoC container and logging abstractions

### Design Patterns
- **Dependency Injection**: Uses Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.Abstractions for loose coupling
- **Logging**: Implements Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Abstractions for centralized logging strategy
- **Separation of Concerns**: Console and desktop applications are separated into distinct projects

### Build and Deployment
- **Target Framework**: .NET 8.0 for modern language features and performance improvements
- **Package Management**: NuGet with PackageReference style for better dependency resolution
- **Configuration**: Uses standard .NET configuration management with runtime configuration files
